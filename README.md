## Lindsey's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This web application showcases my best work so that  future clients can get an idea of my HTML semantic and structural knowledge, as well as my proficiency in CSS Responsive design and styling.

Hope you Enjoy!

### HTML & CSS Tools

Here is a list of the key items that make my portfolio user-friendly across all devices, and some things I used to style my elements:

* **IDs & Class Selectors**: I used a variety of these within my code to style specific items such as, font-size, text-alignment, text-shadow, and more.

* **Flexbox**: I used this in just about every HTML element so that my content would wrap and adjust to the viewport. I had to play around with the height/width of my flex-items to get them visually pleasing, and that was quite the challenge.

* **Google Font, Favicons & Icons**: I added a few links in my meta data to give my application some unique elements.

* **Hover Pseudo Selector**: The hover selector is a fun way to add style and color to anchor links and make them a little less 1999.

* **Box Model**: Changing the padding and margins is a great way to display your elements in different positions across the site.
